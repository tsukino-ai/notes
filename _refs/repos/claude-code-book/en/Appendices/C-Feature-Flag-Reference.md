# Appendix C: Feature Flag Reference

> Feature flags are the core mechanism for implementing compile-time dead code elimination in Claude Code. All flags are injected as boolean values by the compiler during the bundling phase: when a flag is `false`, the code branch it guards is removed entirely, thereby reducing artifact size and protecting unreleased features.
>
> **Type Definitions**:
> - **Compile-time**: The flag is evaluated during the Bun bundling phase; code branches that resolve to `false` are completely absent from the output artifact.
> - **Compile-time + Runtime Gating**: The flag is `true` at compile time, but additional runtime conditions (such as environment variables or server-side configuration) must also be satisfied to truly activate the feature.
>
> **How to Use This Reference**:
> - Navigate to the target flag using the C.1 - C.12 category sections
> - The "Impact Scope" column describes the specific capabilities enabled when the flag is activated
> - The "Dependencies" column describes prerequisite relationships between flags
> - The "Tool Enablement Conditions Reference" table in Appendix B lists the specific tools enabled by each flag and can be used for cross-referencing
