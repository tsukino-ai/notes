# Yù Yú: Decoding Agent Harness

### A Deep Architectural Analysis of Claude Code

<br/>

> *"Of all instruments, the chariot demands the most hands to build."* — *Kǎo Gōng Jì* (Rites of Zhou, c. 300 BC)
>
> In ancient China, the chariot was the most complex system ever engineered. The **yú** (舆, carriage) bears the rider; the shaft sets direction; the spokes transmit force; the linchpin constrains the wheel. Each part has its duty — only together can the vehicle move.
>
> Today, building an AI Agent is no different. The conversation loop is the **shaft**, the tool system the **spokes**, the permission pipeline the **linchpin**, and the runtime framework that bears it all — the Agent Harness — is the **yú**.
>
> This book is thus known as the **"Yú Shū"** (舆书, The Chariot Book).

<br/>

While everyone else teaches you how to **use** AI Agents — **This book dissects one.**

> **How does the dialog loop drive execution? Why is the permission system a four-stage pipeline? How does context compression operate within token budgets? How do sub-agents inherit parent context through Fork?**
>
> Understand Claude Code's design decisions, and you gain a **mental model transferable to any Agent framework**.

## What Makes This Book Different

**Not a usage tutorial. Not a list of prompt tricks.**

The market is saturated with guides on "how to write better prompts" and "how to call Agent APIs." But if you want to understand the **skeleton** of a production-grade Agent system — there's almost nothing to consult. This book fills that gap.

|  | Feature | Description |
|:-:|---------|-------------|
| | **Architecture Analysis, Not API Docs** | Not "how to call," but "why designed this way" — tracing motivations, analyzing trade-offs, identifying anti-patterns |
| | **Design Philosophy, Not Tutorials** | From async generators to circuit breakers, every chapter distills transferable design principles |
| | **Transferable Cognitive Models** | Whether you use LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, or build from scratch — 139 architecture diagrams apply directly |

<details>
<summary><b>By the Numbers</b></summary>

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total word count | 420K characters (Chinese) / 75K+ words (English) |
| Main chapters | 15 chapters + 4 appendices |
| Mermaid architecture/flow/state diagrams | 139 |
| Core subsystems covered | Tool system, permission pipeline, context compression, memory system, hook system, sub-agent dispatch, MCP integration, skill plugins, streaming architecture, Plan mode |

## Background

On March 31, 2026, security researcher [Chaofan Shou (@Fried_rice)](https://x.com/Fried_rice) discovered that the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package on npm contained a build configuration error where source map files referenced an unprotected Cloudflare R2 storage bucket. The disclosure tweet received over 17 million views, sparking unprecedented community discussion about Agent architecture.

This book was born from that discussion — when Agent architecture became a hot topic, we realized the need for a systematic book explaining the design principles of Agent Harness.
